## threats modeling	

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
3. Did we do a good job?

* Assess Scope - What are we working on? This might be as small as a sprint, or as large as a whole system.
* Identify what can go wrong - This can be as simple as a brainstorm, or as structured as using STRIDE, Kill Chains, or Attack Trees.
* Identify countermeasures or manage risk - Decide what youâ€™re going to do about each threat. That might be to implement a mitigation, or to apply the accept/transfer/eliminate approaches of risk management.
* Assess your work - Did you do a good enough job for the system at hand?
