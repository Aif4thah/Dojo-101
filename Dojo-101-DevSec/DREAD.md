# DREAD

afin d'evaluer une vulnérabilité

## Damage potential

If exploited, how harmful could it be?

## Reproducibility

Will attacks succeed every time, some of the time, or only rarely?

## Exploitability

How hard, in terms of technical difficulty, effort, and cost, is the vulnerability to exploit? How long is the attack path?

## Affected users

Will all, some, or only a few users be impacted? Can specific targets be
easily attacked, or are the victims arbitrary?

## Discoverability

How likely is it that attackers will find the vulnerability?
