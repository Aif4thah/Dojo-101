### Dockerfile

The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The buildâ€™s context is the set of files at a specified location PATH or URL. The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.
A context is processed recursively. So, a PATH includes any subdirectories and the URL includes the repository and its submodules. This example shows a build command that uses the current directory as context:

```bash
$ docker build .
```
