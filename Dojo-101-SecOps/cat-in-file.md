## cat in file

```shell
$ cat > MyFile
write the text in the console, when done press CTRL+D
Now, if you’ll open MyFile, you’ll se that it contains the text  you’ve entered. Be carefull as if the file you use is not empty, the  content will be erased before adding what you’re writting. 


cat <<EOF > print.sh
```
