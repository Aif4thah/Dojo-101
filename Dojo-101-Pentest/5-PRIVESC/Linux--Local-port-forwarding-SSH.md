## Local port forwarding

-L is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com. Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.

```
ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.182.55
```
